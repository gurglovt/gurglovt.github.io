    <h3>This is not my dog.</h3>
    <p>
      I found this image a long time ago, maybe in 2020. I don't know whose dog
      it is or even where I originally found it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The image was so funny to me that I got it put on a black tshirt. The
      tshirt is now very old and the black has faded to a sort of grey, and the
      image of the dog has been scraped away and turned into a sort of
      industrial-style abstract expressionist art piece (10cm x 6cm on cotton).
    </p>
    <p>You can click the image if you want to see.</p>

    <p>
      I wonder how much it will fade in total, or if, after enough washes, it
      will eventually become white -- or whatever the <i>true</i> colour is...
      beneath...
    </p>
    <h2>Recurrent thoughts</h2>
    <p>I frequently think about...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the interaction between mind, body and soul</li>
      <li>
        parasitic relationships in nature, and how they resemble the
        relationship between the mind, body and soul
      </li>
      <li>this dog</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      ...and I'm not really sure why that is, but I'm not going to beat myself
      up over it. :)
    </p>
    <h2>List of dogs</h2>
    <p>
      Here's a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_individual_dogs">
        list of dogs</a
      >. Click it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on if what you found was what you expected, or if you expected a
      list of dog breeds, that can reveal if you think of dogs as individuals or
      as groups of sub-ethnicities. I think it's always best to think of
      individuals, as prejudices (assumptions) can of course make an ass out of
      you and me.
