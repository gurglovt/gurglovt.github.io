    <h3>This is not my dog.</h3>
    <p>
      I found this image a long time ago, maybe in 2020. I don't know whose dog
      it is or even where I originally found it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The image was so funny to me that I got it put on a black tshirt. The
      tshirt is now very old and the black has faded to a sort of grey, and the
      image of the dog has been scraped away and turned into a sort of
      industrial-style abstract expressionist art piece (10cm x 6cm on cotton).
    </p>
    <p>You can click the image if you want to see.</p>

    <p>
      I wonder how much it will fade in total, or if, after enough washes, it
      will eventually become white -- or whatever the <i>true</i> colour is...
      beneath...
    </p>
    <h2>I have recurrent thoughts</h2>
    <p>I frequently think about...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the impossible overlapping of the mind, body, and the soul</li>
      <li>the mind and soul as parasites to the body</li>
      <li>this dog</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      ...and I'm not really sure why that is, but I'm not going to beat myself
      up over it. :)
    </p>
    <h2>List of dogs</h2>
    <p>
      Here's a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_individual_dogs">
        list of dogs</a
      >. Click it.
    </p>
    <p>If you did not click it, please do so.</p>
    <p>
      Did you expect a list of <i>individual</i> dogs? I think most people would
      expect a list of dog <i>breeds</i>. I'm always looking to subvert
      expectations, surprise and enthrall! You could almost describe this
      particular subversion as a kind of <i>prank</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn't my intention, but, if I subverted your expectations with that
      link, you can consider yourself <i>pranked</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were you <i>pranked</i>? If so, I'd say something like "I really got you
      good there." If not, maybe I'll have better luck next time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe you never even clicked the link ãƒ¼ That would mean that you've
      beaten me. This would be quite embarrassing for me, but it's really not in
      good fun to go around trying to make people look the fool. I'd encourage
      you to
      <i>be nice</i> herein.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an aside, there's a button just below here that will change your name
      on the site. You can make it say something crude like "Listen to me, you
      bitch." (insulting yourself) or "Listen to me, I stink so bad." (insulting
      me). It's here that I'll also subtly remind you to be nice.
